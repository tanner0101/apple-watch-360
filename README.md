# ï£¿ Watch 360

Copy and paste this JavaScript code into any of the Apple Watch pages with a 360 view to get a beautiful, automated viewing experience.

## How to copy and paste it

It looks best on Safari, so open that up and make sure you have developer mode enabled. Then, right click anywhere on a page with a 360 viewer and select "Insepct Element." Then, paste the code from `apple-watch-360.js` (view raw to easily copy) into the bar at the bottom next to the `>`. Once you have pasted it, just hit <kbd>Return</kbd> and enjoy. :)
